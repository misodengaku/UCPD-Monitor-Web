# UCPD-Monitor

[English](README.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

A cross-platform web application for real-time monitoring and analysis of USB Power Delivery (PD) communication captured by STM32 UCPD hardware using WebSerial.

It reads `.cpd` binary streams produced by STM32CubeMonitor-UCPD and decodes them against the **USB PD Revision 3.2, Version 1.0 (2023-10)** specification — providing a live Connection View, a fully-decoded message table, and clipboard-ready export.

---

## Background

The **STM32G071B-DISCO** board from STMicroelectronics includes a UCPD SPY mode that passively captures USB PD packets on the CC line and streams them to a host PC via USB-UART as `.cpd` binary data, using the companion tool **STM32CubeMonitor-UCPD** (USB PD 2.0/3.0). UCPD-Monitor accepts the same `.cpd` stream and decodes it using a parser built from scratch against **USB PD Rev 3.2** — covering EPR, AVS, extended messages, and Source_Info — without requiring STM32CubeMonitor-UCPD.

## Features

- **Live Serial Monitoring** — Connect to any STM32 UCPD device via USB-UART and receive PD frames in real time
- **`.cpd` File Import** — Drag-and-drop or open `.cpd` binary files captured by STM32CubeMonitor-UCPD; server-side parsing eliminates ring-buffer mismatches. The current Live log is automatically cleared before import and import data is never duplicated into the session file.
- **USB PD Rev 3.2 Decoder** — Full decode of Control, Data, and Extended messages including EPR, PPS, AVS, and SPR-AVS. Structured VDM (Discover Identity / SVIDs / Modes) fully decoded per §6.4.4.3 with per-field binary notation and vendor name lookup (Lenovo, Google, Apple, STMicro, Intel …).
- **Connection View** — Visual topology of Source / Cable (eMarker) / Sink. SOURCE node shows confirmed output voltage and current/power after PS_RDY. SINK node shows **V.req** (requested voltage) and calculated power. PDO grids display `I.max` / `P.max` for Source PDOs and `I.op` / `P.op` for Sink PDOs, matching USB PD Rev 3.2 semantics. **Spec badges** (SrcSpecBadge / SinkSpecBadge) display vendor name, PID, EPR RDY, Cap_Ext, VDM, and PDP — Cap_Ext lights only when the corresponding Extended Capabilities message is actually received.
- **Message Table** — High-performance virtual scroll ([@tanstack/react-virtual](https://tanstack.com/virtual)) handles 1 000 + rows smoothly. Expandable PDO/RDO child rows with O(n) RDO-to-source-PDO resolution. **VDM 2-level collapsible tree**: Discover Identity section headers (ID HEADER, CERT STAT, PRODUCT, UFP VDO …) are individually expandable with ▸ / ▾ toggles. Column widths are user-resizable; the rightmost "Parsed" column auto-fills the remaining window width and is stable across tree-expand and window resize.
- **Row Selection & Clipboard Copy** — Click / Shift-click range selection; Ctrl+C or right-click to copy rows as TSV (with `DATA:HEX` raw suffix)
- **Auto-scroll with Jump-to-Latest** — Automatic scroll to newest message; floats a button to return after manual browsing
- **Session File Save** — Live frames are automatically written to a timestamped `.cpd` file for later replay. The serial port is cleanly disconnected and the session file flushed on application quit.
- **Unknown Packet Log** — Unrecognised frames are appended to `logs/unknown_packets.yaml` for diagnostics
- **Panel Toggles** — Show/hide Connection View and Console panels independently

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports WebSerial (Chrome, Edge, etc.)
- An STM32 UCPD device connected via USB

### Running the Application (Development)

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Static Deployment

For production deployment, the application can be built as a static site:

1. Build the static application: `npm run build`
2. The static files will be generated in `client/dist/`
3. Deploy these files to any static web server (nginx, Apache, etc.)

See [STATIC_DEPLOYMENT.md](STATIC_DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## Usage

### Connecting to a Device

1. Plug the STM32 UCPD device into a USB port.
2. Select the COM port from the dropdown in the title bar, or check the "WebSerial" box to use WebSerial.
3. Click **Connect**. Live PD frames appear immediately.

### Importing a `.cpd` File

- Click the **.cpd Import** button in the title bar, or
- Drag and drop one or more `.cpd` files anywhere onto the window.

The entire file is parsed server-side and replayed as a `HISTORY` message — DETACHED/ATTACHED events are preserved and no ring-buffer truncation occurs.

### Copying Messages

1. Click a row to select it. Shift-click to extend the selection.
2. Press **Ctrl+C** or right-click and choose **Copy N rows**.

Each row is copied as a tab-separated line:

```
#id   Timestamp   Dir   SOP   Rev   MsgID   Type   #DO   Parsed Summary   DATA:HEXRAW
```

Rows without a parsed summary show the raw payload as `DATA:HEXRAW` directly in the summary column.

- Battery RDO carries power fields in 250 mW units (`opPower_mW` / `limPower_mW`).
- GiveBack flag dynamically switches Max/Min labels in RDO child rows.
